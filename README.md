I’m an HCI researcher passionate about mobility and accessibility. My experience spans academia and industry. I collaborate with users, government, and NGOs to develop solutions that are not just impactful, but also practical and user-centered.

I recently completed my PhD from the Université de technologie de Troyes, and Naver Labs Europe under the joint supervision of [Matthieu Tixier](https://dblp.org/pid/82/3967.html) and [Tommaso Colombino](https://dblp.org/pid/50/3140.html).
