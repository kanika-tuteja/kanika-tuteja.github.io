Thank you for your interest in my profile! 

I am a mixed-methods HCI researcher passionate about disability, mobility, technological innovation, and global development. My experience in developing interventions for people with disabilities is primarily based on conducting qualitative fieldwork to understand users' needs and environments. This approach allows me to create impactful solutions that empower individuals with disabilities in low-resource settings. 

In 2018, I moved to France, where I worked for the last five years at Naver Labs Europe in the UXE (User Experience and Ethnography) team. 

## Background

I recently completed my PhD from the Université de technologie de Troyes, and Naver Labs Europe under the joint supervision of [Matthieu Tixier](https://dblp.org/pid/82/3967.html) and [Tommaso Colombino](https://dblp.org/pid/50/3140.html). My thesis topic, 'A Trajectory Analysis of Wheelchairs in India' - Assistive Technology Design for Mobility Ecosystems, explored challenges and opportunities for wheelchair users in India. Through extensive ethnographic fieldwork in rural and urban parts of Karnataka, I investigated the experiences of people with physical impairment (PMI) and their ecosystem. A trajectory analysis spanning the production, acquisition, use, and recycling of wheelchairs uncovers the complex socio-environmental dynamics influencing PMIs' mobility, inquiring future assistive technology design in India.

I hold a Master's degree in UX design, a research-based program from MIT Pune, and completed my graduation project as part of the HCI team at Conduent Labs (Erstwhile Xerox Research Centre) under the guidance of [Sitara Shah](https://dl.acm.org/profile/99659305474)  and [Saurabh Srivastava](https://dl.acm.org/profile/81498656208)  where I designed, and implemented an intelligent decision support system for a civic agency that reveals actionable insights to improve commuters experiences.

## Personal Mission

My professional ethos is firmly rooted in user-centric design. Hailing from India, where Hindi is my native language, I adopt the principle 'know your user' (KYU), resonating with the Hindi word 'KYU,' meaning 'why.' This principle guides my belief in the power of working closely with people to understand their needs rather than making assumptions. My experience spans academia and industry. I collaborate with users, government, and NGOs to develop solutions that are not just impactful but also practical and user-centered.

## Research Interests

My research spans assistive technology, human-computer interaction, design, and social development. I am deeply committed to engaging with individuals with diverse disabilities to explore how technology impacts their daily mobility. 

I enjoy hiking and spending time outside in nature in my spare time.
